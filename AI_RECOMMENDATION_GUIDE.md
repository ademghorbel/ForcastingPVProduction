```
Get your free API key from: [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

### Step 2: Configure Battery Storage
1. Enable **"🔋 Enable Battery Storage"** in sidebar
2. Set your battery specifications:
   - Total capacity in kWh
   - Current charge level (%)
   - Expected daily consumption
3. Review the battery status display

### Step 3: Fetch Weather Data
1. Enter your location (city, country code)
2. Click **"🔄 Fetch Weather & Predict"**
3. Wait for weather and production forecast

### Step 4: Get AI Recommendation
1. Click **"💡 Get AI Recommendation"** button
2. AI analyzes:
   - Current weather conditions
   - 24-48 hour forecast
   - Your battery configuration
   - Expected consumption patterns
3. Review detailed analysis and recommendation

### Step 5: Act on Recommendation
- 🟢 **CHARGE**: Start charging battery (abundant production expected)
- 🔴 **DISCHARGE**: Use battery power (low production expected)
- 🟡 **MAINTAIN**: Keep current state (balanced conditions)

## Persona Prompting Details

The agent uses this expert persona:

> "You are an expert energy production analyst with deep expertise in:
> - Solar PV energy forecasting and production analysis
> - Battery storage management and optimization
> - Weather-based energy production modeling
> - Real-time decision making for charging/discharging strategies
> - Maximizing energy independence and grid efficiency"

This makes the AI provide responses like a professional energy consultant would.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Sunny Day - Charge
```
Current: 3.5 kW production, Clear skies, Low cloud cover
Forecast: Expected 45+ kWh generation next 24 hours
Battery: Currently at 40%

✓ Recommendation: CHARGE
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Clear skies with high irradiation will provide optimal charging window
Timing: Start immediately, peak charging 10:00-14:00
```

### Scenario 2: Stormy Day - Discharge
```
Current: 0.2 kW production, Heavy clouds, 90% cloud cover
Forecast: Expected 8 kWh generation next 24 hours
Battery: Currently at 75%

✓ Recommendation: DISCHARGE
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Storm system moving in, production will drop significantly
Timing: Begin discharge to preserve power for evening/night
Risk: If storm clears early, may need to switch to charging
```

### Scenario 3: Transitional Weather - Maintain
```
Current: 1.8 kW production, Partly cloudy, 45% cloud cover
Forecast: Expected 20 kWh generation next 24 hours
Battery: Currently at 50%

✓ Recommendation: MAINTAIN
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Variable cloud patterns, maintain flexibility
Timing: Monitor conditions hourly, be ready to switch strategies
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OpenRouter API Key Required"
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is in `.env`
2. Restart the Streamlit app
3. Get free API key from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
4. Verify the key starts with `sk-or-v1-`

### Issue: "Error generating recommendation"
**Solution**:
1. Verify internet connection
2. Check API key is valid at [OpenRouter.ai Dashboard](https://openrouter.ai)
3. Ensure weather data was fetched successfully
4. Check .env file is properly formatted (no extra spaces)

### Issue: Recommendation takes too long
**Solution**:
1. This is normal (2-10 seconds) for first request using thinking models
2. Subsequent requests should be faster (5-8 seconds)
3. Check your internet connection speed
4. Verify OpenRouter API service status at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)

## Next Steps

1. **Configure your battery**: Set realistic capacity and consumption values
2. **Enable recommendations**: Use the AI feature with real weather data
3. **Monitor results**: Track recommendation accuracy over time
4. **Refine settings**: Adjust battery parameters based on actual usage
5. **Integrate more services**: Add notifications or automation based on recommendations
